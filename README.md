## Building Information Moduling Software

- [AutoDesk Revit](https://www.autodesk.com.cn/products/revit) - Revit is a powerful Building Information Modeling (BIM) software that enables architects, engineers, and construction professionals to design, visualize, and collaborate on projects in a 3D virtual environment. With its advanced features and intuitive interface, Revit streamlines the design and construction process, improving efficiency and accuracy in the industry.
- [BIMServer](https://github.com/opensourceBIM/BIMserver) -  BIMserver is an open-source server platform based on the IFC standard, which centrally manages BIM models using an object-oriented approach. It allows direct uploading, reading, and manipulation of BIM models through a web browser.

- [Blender](https://github.com/blender/blender) - Blender is the free and open source 3D creation suite. It supports the entirety of the 3D pipeline-modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing, motion tracking and video editing.

## IFC Tools

- [IfcOpenShell](https://github.com/IfcOpenShell/IfcOpenShell) - IfcOpenShell is a suite of developer libraries and utilities to manipulate OpenBIM data.[![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/IfcOpenShell/IfcOpenShell)](https://github.com/IfcOpenShell/IfcOpenShell/stargazers)[![GitHub forks](https://img.shields.io/github/forks/IfcOpenShell/IfcOpenShell)](https://github.com/IfcOpenShell/IfcOpenShell/network)![GitHub contributors](https://img.shields.io/github/contributors/IfcOpenShell/IfcOpenShell)![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/IfcOpenShell/IfcOpenShell)[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/IfcOpenShell/IfcOpenShell)](https://github.com/IfcOpenShell/IfcOpenShell/blob/master/LICENSE)
- [SikongSphere IfcTools](https://github.com/SikongSphere/sikongsphere-ifctools) - SikongSphere-ifctools aims to build an open-source ecosystem for Building Information Modeling (BIM) based on the Industry Foundation Class (IFC) standard. It focuses on implementing and extending functionality interfaces for the IFC standard, serving as a core toolkit rather than a specific data product.[![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/SikongSphere/sikongsphere-ifctools)](https://github.com/IfcOpenShell/IfcOpenShell/stargazers)[![GitHub forks](https://img.shields.io/github/forks/SikongSphere/sikongsphere-ifctools)](https://github.com/IfcOpenShell/IfcOpenShell/network)![GitHub contributors](https://img.shields.io/github/contributors/SikongSphere/sikongsphere-ifctools)![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/SikongSphere/sikongsphere-ifctools)[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/SikongSphere/sikongsphere-ifctools)](https://github.com/SikongSphere/sikongsphere-ifctools/blob/master/LICENSE)
